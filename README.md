# üëã Hey, I'm highmachs
*Cybersecurity Explorer | Offensive Security Enthusiast | Building the Future of Autonomous Security*


## üî• About Me
I‚Äôm a CSE (Cybersecurity) student and a passionate **Space, Cybersecurity, and Aviation Enthusiast**.  
Focused on **offensive security, threat hunting, and automated defense experiments**. I lead student projects, build prototypes, and sharpen skills through CTFs, labs, and hands-on research.


## üöÄ Current Focus
- **Autonomous Security Systems:** Designing and testing modular defensive & offensive workflows  
- **Honeypot Experiments:** Learning attacker behavior and automation responses  
- **Red Team Skills:** Web exploitation, enumeration, scripting, and advanced threat simulations  
- **Future Exploration:** Quantum-safe security, exploit development, and automated defense intelligence

‚ö° Fun Fact
I‚Äôm merging offense and defense to understand attacks before they happen‚Äîthink of it as my personal mini cyber lab. 
Beyond the digital battlefield, I‚Äôm a part time guitarist and pianist/keyboardist, constantly exploring music as another form of expression and strategy. I‚Äôm an avid reader of space exploration, aviation, cryptography, quantum tech, and futuristic science, always chasing the edges of human knowledge. I'm also very fascinated by the SETI and other Space Exploration

> ‚ÄúThis world is rotten, and those who are making it rot deserve to vanish! Someone has to do it, so why not me? Even if it means sacrificing my own mind and soul, it's worth it. Because the world... can't go on like this! Is there anyone out there other than me who'd be willing to eliminate the trash from the world? If I don't do it, then who will? That's just it; there's no one! I can do it! In fact... I'm the only one who can! I'll do it. I'll change the world....‚Äù ‚Äì Light Yagami (God of the New World)
