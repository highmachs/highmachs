*Cybersecurity Explorer | Offensive Security Enthusiast | Building the Future of Autonomous Security | Co-Owner of AhiLight*

## 🔥 About Me
I’m a Cybersecurity student and relentless offensive security enthusiast with a passion for **Space, Aviation, Finance and Futuristic CyberSecurity experiments**.
I lead Multiple Modern student projects, develop prototypes, and sharpen my skills through CTFs, practical labs, and real-world research. 
My focus is **mastering red teaming**, **threat hunting**, and **autonomous defense intelligence** to stay ahead of evolving threats.

## 🚀 Current Focus
- **Autonomous Security Systems:** Designing and testing modular defensive and offensive workflows  
- **Honeypot Experiments:** Learning attacker behavior and automation responses  
- **Red Team Skills:** Web exploitation, enumeration, scripting, and advanced threat simulations  
- **Future Exploration:** Quantum safe security, exploit development, and automated defense intelligence
