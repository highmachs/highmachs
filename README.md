# 👋 Hey, I'm highmachs
*Cybersecurity Explorer | Offensive Security Enthusiast | Building the Future of Autonomous Security*

## 🔥 About Me
I’m a CSE (Cybersecurity) student and a passionate **Space, Cybersecurity, and Aviation Enthusiast**.  
Focused on **offensive security, threat hunting, and autonomous defense experiments**. I lead student projects, build prototypes, and sharpen skills through CTFs, labs, and hands-on research.

## 🚀 Current Focus
- **Autonomous Security Systems:** Designing and testing modular defensive and offensive workflows  
- **Honeypot Experiments:** Learning attacker behavior and automation responses  
- **Red Team Skills:** Web exploitation, enumeration, scripting, and advanced threat simulations  
- **Future Exploration:** Quantum safe security, exploit development, and automated defense intelligence

⚡ Fun Fact  
I’m merging offense and defense to understand attacks before they happen—think of it as my personal mini cyber lab. Beyond the digital battlefield, I play guitar and piano and read about space exploration, cryptography, and futuristic tech. I follow SETI and other space projects closely.
